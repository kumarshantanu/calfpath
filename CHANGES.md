# calfpath Changes and TODO


## TODO

* [TODO - BREAKING CHANGE] Rename the abstraction uri-template to path
* [TODO - BREAKING CHANGE] Consider `clojure.walk` as routes navigation tool
* [TODO] Include [quickstart] complete server examples using Ring and Machhiato
* [TODO] Return numeric direction (lower/higher) indicator in URI matching
* [Todo] Do not finalize FULL-MATCH (in request) in a partial-match request
  - because we don't know if it's a full match; it's determined by a future token


## 0.8.1 / 2021-February-03

- Bugfix
  - Expect only index-key (e.g. `:id`) in indexable route in `calfpath.route/make-index`
    - Bug: Expects `:handler` to be present in identifiable route
  - Include URI pattern wildcard suffix in `calfpath.route/make-index`
    - Bug: URI wildcard suffix is stripped when indexing routes
  - Group common URI pattern into sub-routes
    - Bug: Common URI pattern in routes should be grouped together
- Enhancement
  - Support path params notation `:param` and `{param}`, e.g. `/foo/:param/bar` and `/foo/{param}/bar`


## 0.8.0 / 2020-December-17

* [BREAKING CHANGE] Drop support

  - Matchex
    - Direct handler invocation for identity matcher
    - Use `if-some`/`when-some` instead of `if-let`/`when-let` everywhere
    - Use bulk methods matcher when all routes match methods
* Documentation

## 0.7.0 / 2019-January-03

* Routes
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Allow argument `params-key` instead of looking up route spec

  * Avoid allocating MatchResult object on route full-match with no params
    * [IMPL CHANGE] Drop `MatchResult.fullMatch()` in favour of `MatchResult.FULL_MATCH_NO_PARAMS`
  * Allocate param map (in `Util.matchURI()`) to hold only as many params as likely


## 0.6.0 / 2018-April-30

* [BREAKING CHANGE] Drop support for Clojure versions 1.5 and 1.6
  * Supported Clojure versions: 1.7, 1.8, 1.9
* [BREAKING CHANGE] Rename `calfpath.route/make-routes` to `calfpath.route/compile-routes`
* Routes: Put URI params under an optional key in request map (by adding pair `:uri-params <request-key>` to route)
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Update `calfpath.route/make-uri-matcher` arity - accept an extra argument `uri-params-key`
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] In middleware `lift-key-middleware` accept `lift-keys` collection instead of single `lift-key`
  * Refactor `calfpath.route/compile-routes`

## 0.4.0 / 2016-October-13

* Make URI-match work for partial matches and URI prefixes
  * A partial URI pattern may be expressed with a `*` suffix
  * Zero or more partial URI patterns may exist in a route tree

* Middleware
  * A helper fn `calfpath.route/update-in-each-route` to apply route attribute wrapper to specs
  * A lift-key middleware `calfpath.route/lift-key-middleware` to split routes with mixed specs

* Helper fn `calfpath.route/make-routes` to build routes from given route specs
* Allow non-literal string URI-patterns in `calfpath.core/->uri`
