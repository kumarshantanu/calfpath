## 0.7.0 / 2019-January-03

* Routes
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Allow argument `params-key` instead of looking up route spec
    * Accept `params-key` in `calfpath.route/make-uri-matcher` - no route spec lookup

* Routes: Put URI params under an optional key in request map (by adding pair `:uri-params <request-key>` to route)
  * [BREAKING CHANGE] Update `calfpath.route/make-uri-matcher` arity - accept an extra argument `uri-params-key`

## 0.4.0 / 2016-October-13

* Make URI-match work for partial matches and URI prefixes
  * A partial URI pattern may be expressed with a `*` suffix
  * Zero or more partial URI patterns may exist in a route tree
  * This may impact how URIs in HTTP-400 responses are generated
* Middleware
  * A helper fn `calfpath.route/update-in-each-route` to apply route attribute wrapper to specs
  * A lift-key middleware `calfpath.route/lift-key-middleware` to split routes with mixed specs
  * A ring-route middleware `calfpath.route/ring-handler-middleware` to wrap Ring handlers into route handlers
* Helper fn `calfpath.route/make-routes` to build routes from given route specs
* Allow non-literal string URI-patterns in `calfpath.core/->uri`

* Support for extensible routes as a first-class abstraction
  * A dispatcher fn that walks given routes to match request and invoke corresponding handler
  * An optimized (through loop unrolling) way to create a dispatcher fn from given routes
  * Helper fns to manipulate routes at shallow and deep levels

* Dispatch (macro) on URI template by evaluating expression in lexical scope
* Dispatch (macro) on HTTP method by evaluating expression
